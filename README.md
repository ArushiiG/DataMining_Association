# DataMining_Association

Association rule mining is a very good technique to implement a session-based
recommendation system. The basic idea behind a recommendation system is that if a person
buys a and b items together, the system will provide recommendations in the future to another
person who is buying either a or b.
The recommendation system can be incorporated in any E-commerce platform. This
incorporation of the system can play an important role in the advancement of the company as
well as it eases the process for the users to find a better-suited product. The personalised
suggestions that the e-commerce platforms make to any consumers generates a significant
portion of their revenue.
